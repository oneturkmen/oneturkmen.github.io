### NEAT and Fixed NN (2019)

The "Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies" (NEAT) algorithm written in Python.
Compared with an algorithm for evolving fixed topology network. Used *numpy*, *matplotlib*,
*networkx* for depicting graphs, and *gym* for OpenAI Gym.

### Fake News Generator (2018)

Final project for machine learning class at the U of Wyoming. Used Markov chains and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks
for text generation. Compared both in terms of quality of the generated text. Wrote algorithms in *Python* and a small report in *LaTeX*.

### Blog for Ultimate Frisbee players (2017)

Blog written in *Node.js*, with *MongoDB* for storage, and *Socket.IO* for chat. Purely for learning purposes.

### Safeminer (2017)

App for geotagging and geotracking hazards on a construction site.
Built with *Node.js*, *MongoDB* (with geolocation features),
and *Materialize* (CSS). Developed within 30-40 hours at a hackathon in Denver, CO.

### Front-end Compiler for Decaf (2017)

Wrote a front-end compiler (lexical, syntax and semantic analysis with type checking) for Decaf, a subset of Java.
Part of CS coursework done at the U of Wyoming. Used *C++* (*Flex* and *Bison*).

### Composing fractals (2017)

Tiny *Haskell* implementation of the "Composing Fractals" paper by Mark P. Jones. Generates fractals using
ASCII characters as well as OpenGL (GLUT).
