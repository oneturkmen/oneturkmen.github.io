Hi there!

I am a machine learning engineer at [Borealis AI](https://borealisai.com/),
an AI research institute founded by the [Royal Bank of Canada](https://rbc.com).
I build data-intensive software systems that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for applications in
finance (credit risk, model robustness and fairness).

Previously, I completed a Master of Science in Computer Science from the [University of Alberta](https://ualberta.ca)
in program analysis and code mining. I had an opportunity to be
[the first author of two papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dpV2oe0AAAAJ)
published in two large software engineering conferences (ICSE 2021 and ICSME 2022).
I also worked as a software engineer at a blockchain/AI startup in Bulgaria.
