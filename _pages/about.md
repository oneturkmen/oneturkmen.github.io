Hi there!

I am a software engineer on the ML Foundations team at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/),
where I help build core infrastructure for scalable ML across the company.

Previously, I worked in [the AI division of a big Canadian bank](https://rbcborealis.com), focusing on ML serving and observability within the credit domain.

I hold an MSc in CS from the [University of Alberta](https://ualberta.ca),
where I focused on preventing API misuses through program analysis and code
mining. I was fortunate to be [the first author of two
papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dpV2oe0AAAAJ) published at
software engineering conferences (ICSE 2021 and ICSME 2022).
