Hi there!

I am a machine learning software engineer at [Borealis
AI](https://borealisai.com/), an AI research institute backed by [Royal Bank of
Canada](https://rbc.com). I help build software systems that leverage AI for
applications in finance (e.g., model robustness and fairness).

I live in [Montreal](https://montreal.ca/), a North American city with a European touch.
