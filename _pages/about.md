Hi there!

I am a machine learning engineer at [Borealis AI](https://borealisai.com/),
an AI research institute founded by the [Royal Bank of Canada](https://rbc.com).
I build data-intensive machine learning systems for
enhancing banking and financial applications (credit risk, explainability, robustness and fairness).

Previously, I completed a Master of Science in Computer Science from the [University of Alberta](https://ualberta.ca)
where I used data mining techniques for program analysis. I had an opportunity to be
[the first author of two papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dpV2oe0AAAAJ)
published in two large software engineering conferences (ICSE 2021 and ICSME 2022).
I also worked as a software engineer at an AI startup in Bulgaria.
