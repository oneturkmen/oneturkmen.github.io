Hello there! I am Batyr, an incoming graduate student to the 
[<span style="color: #007c41;">University of Alberta</span>](https://www.ualberta.ca).
I obtained my Bachelor's degree (with CS as major and Math as minor) from the [<span style="color: #0d335f;">American University in Bulgaria</span>](https://www.aubg.edu/).

Tech interests include:

- *Systems programming and software engineering*.
- *Machine learning (ML) and evolutionary algorithms*.
- *Functional programming (FP) and applied category theory*.

Technologies used (check out [`/projects`](https://oneturkmen.github.io/projects/) as well):

- *Systems.* C++ and Rust.
- *ML.* Python with `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `keras`, and `jupyter` notebooks.
- *FP*. Haskell. (as a pure FP language, not as partially applied paradigm).
- *Web stuff*. Node.js, Twitter Bootstrap.
- *Databases*. MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
- *Infrastructure*. Docker, GitLab, Heroku.
- *Miscellaneous*. LaTeX (math), Java (OOP university course), Bash (scripting).

**P.S.** The website is still in an *experimental* state; you may see things being changed next time you visit.
