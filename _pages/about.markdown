Hello there! My name is Batyr and I am a graduate student at the 
[<span style="color: #007c41;">University of Alberta</span>](https://www.ualberta.ca),
where I am doing research at the 
[<span style="color: #DAA520;">Software Maintenance and Reuse Lab</span>](https://sarahnadi.org/smr/).
Prior to that, I obtained my BA in Computer Science from [<span style="color: #0d335f;">the American University in
Bulgaria</span>](https://www.aubg.edu/).

My research focuses on software engineering, particularly tools and techniques
to increase software variability and reuse (software product lines,
variability implementation strategies, etc.). I am also interested
in program analysis tools, their applications, capabilities and drawbacks.

In the past, I have worked with a variety of tools and languages such as:

- *Systems.* Rust / C++.
- *ML.* Python with `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `keras`, and `jupyter` notebooks.
- *Web stuff*. Node.js, Twitter Bootstrap.
- *Databases*. MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
- *Infrastructure*. Docker, GitLab, Heroku.
- *Miscellaneous*. LaTeX, Java, Haskell, Bash (scripting).

**P.S.** The website is still in an *experimental* state; you may see things being changed next time you visit.
