Hello there! My name is Batyr and I am a graduate student at the
[<span style="color: #007c41;">University of Alberta</span>](https://www.ualberta.ca),
where I am doing research under the supervision of Dr. Sarah Nadi at the 
[<span style="color: #DAA520;">Software Maintenance and Reuse Lab</span>](https://sarahnadi.org/smr/).
Prior to that, I obtained my BA in Computer Science from [<span style="color: #0d335f;">the American University in
Bulgaria</span>](https://www.aubg.edu/).

My research strives to detect and prevent Java API misuses. See [<span
style="color: #1b96f3;">Research</span>](https://batyr.dev/research).


In the past, I have worked with a variety of tools and languages such as:

- *Languages.* Rust, C++, Python, JavaScript (Node.js, React.js), Java.
- *ML.* Python libs such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `keras`, and `jupyter` notebooks.
- *Web stuff*. Node.js, Twitter Bootstrap.
- *Databases and indexes*. MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch.
- *Infrastructure*. Docker, Gitlab, Travis, Circle CI, Heroku, bash.
- *Miscellaneous*. LaTeX, Sonic Pi.
