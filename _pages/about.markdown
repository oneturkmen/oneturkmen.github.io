My name is Batyr and I am incoming graduate CS student to the University of Alberta, Edmonton.

My interests (not only research) include:

- Systems programming (with Rust and C++)
- Machine learning and evolutionary algorithms (applied for NP problems like SAT and TSP)
- Functional programming and category theory (not just monads)
- Green tea, and oatmeal for breakfast.

Projects are open-sourced on Github (link below).
