Hello there! My name is Batyr and I am a graduate student at the 
[<span style="color: #007c41;">University of Alberta</span>](https://www.ualberta.ca).
I obtained my Bachelor's degree (with CS as major and Math as minor) from the
[<span style="color: #0d335f;">American University in
Bulgaria</span>](https://www.aubg.edu/).

I am doing research in the intersection of software engineering (SE) and compilers.
My goal is to apply methods and techniques of the former to increase variability and reuse of the latter.

In general, my tech interests include:

- *Systems software engineering, static analysis, compiler theory*.
- *Scalable machine learning, evolutionary algorithms*.

Technologies used (check out [`/projects`](https://oneturkmen.github.io/projects/) as well):

- *Systems.* Rust / C++.
- *ML.* Python with `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `keras`, and `jupyter` notebooks.
- *FP*. Haskell.
- *Web stuff*. Node.js, Twitter Bootstrap.
- *Databases*. MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
- *Infrastructure*. Docker, GitLab, Heroku.
- *Miscellaneous*. LaTeX, Java, Bash (scripting).

**P.S.** The website is still in an *experimental* state; you may see things being changed next time you visit.
