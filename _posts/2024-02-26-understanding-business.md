## Understand business needs and challenges

Programmers typically don't like to get involved in the business aspect of their work,
particularly early in their careers. They get assigned some tickets, get them done, and repeat. Most of the job
is coding new features, writing some tests for them, maybe even documentation,
as well as deployment to production, following the typical software engineering
cycle (TODO: Add citation).

However, only focusing on coding and not understanding the bigger picture of the work
that is done is actually counter-productive over longer term. Here are some outcomes
that the engineer themself might experience:

1. Not taking ownership. It is hard to take ownership of something when you don't understand
the "why".

2. Hard to progress in career since you are expected to have larger-scoped responsibilities
and dealing with ambiguities.

3. ???
